      <h3>Robert Hainitz</h3>
      <p>For the second part of my professional career, I have been an exceptionally accomplished <strong>physics and mathematics teacher and lecturer</strong> with a proven track record. Before this, I was a highly successful executive in the ICT technical support business, managing organisations of over 300 people. I combine commercial know-how with excellent operational and people management skills, and I am a conceptual, strategic thinker with advanced analytical capabilities who employs both commercial and scientific methodologies to achieve operational goals and business targets.</p>
      <p>I am based in Oxford, UK, and am the founder of <strong>Oxford Advanced Learning (OAL)</strong>, a company initiative dedicated to providing premium services for the educational sector. These services include consultancy for university applications, private tutoring with a team of subject specialists, and software products that help teachers and schools in the recruitment process (<strong>TeacherSearch</strong>) and in advanced digital learning (<strong>IRMaths</strong>). OAL’s software products are at the frontier of modern pedagogy, incorporating advanced AI capabilities based on Google’s Gemini platform.</p>
      <p><strong>Oxford Advanced Learning</strong> works in close partnership with <strong>IREducation</strong>, a dynamic company founded by one of my former prodigy students.</p>

  <h2>IR-AI: Adaptive Educational Tutor</h2>
  <p>This is a highly advanced, interactive and personalised AI tutor, designed to retain user memory and adapt dynamically to each student’s learning style, pace, and academic goals. Scheduled for launch before March 2026, this AI system will be integrated across all of our educational platforms, including IRMaths, IRChemistry, and IRPhysics. It will also be offered as a standalone model for institutional licensing and commercial sale.</p>
  <p>Built on advanced natural language processing and reinforcement learning, the system provides real-time feedback, adaptive difficulty progression, and exam-focused coaching. Designed with ethical AI principles at its core, it also includes features to support SEND learners, ensuring accessibility and inclusivity for a diverse student population.</p><br>

<section id="teachersearch">
  <h2>TeacherSearch – TAP Platform</h2>
  <p>Our <strong>Teacher Applicational Platform (TAP)</strong> addresses inefficiencies in educator recruitment. Teachers create unified profiles while schools can filter and recruit with precision. Launching late 2025, TeacherSearch will:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Streamline job applications</li>
    <li>Support state schools facing shortages</li>
    <li>Create a centralised hiring ecosystem</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Designed with teachers in mind, this platform eliminates the need for repetitive, manual form-filling across different schools and institutions. Instead, educators can create a comprehensive, centralised profile detailing their qualifications, experience, and teaching preferences. Schools will then be able to search, filter, and connect directly with suitable candidates who have expressed interest in their vacancies. This approach not only saves time for teachers but also improves efficiency for school hiring processes — ultimately fostering better matches between schools and educators. The platform will be particularly beneficial for state schools facing staffing shortages, providing them with access to a broad and diverse pool of qualified candidates.</p><br>

<section id="fractionalcalc">
  <h2>Fractional Calculus Course</h2>
  <p>Our <strong>Fractional Calculus Course</strong> aims to foster independent mathematical research and innovation among AS and A2 Further Mathematics students, focusing on advanced topics in fractional and complex-order calculus. By engaging in original mathematical investigation — from conceptual formulation to numerical experimentation and formal exposition — students will :</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Develop research-level mathematical thinking</li>
    <li>Acquire LaTeX and academic writing skills applicable to university-level mathematics</li>
    <li>Explore pure mathematics beyond the A-level syllabus, focusing on real and complex analysis, special functions, and numerical methods</li>
    <li>Produce a publishable research paper to be submitted to the arXiv preprint server or other undergraduate mathematical journals, which they can put in their personal statements</li>
    <li>Provide a structured and rigorous alternative to the EPQ, especially for students interested in pure mathematics where humanities-related topics are more preferred</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Please contact <a href="mailto:isaacteng@ireducation.org" target="_blank">isaacteng@ireducation.org</a> for any enquiries.</p>
