<section id="teachersearch">
  <h2>TeacherSearch – TAP Platform</h2>
  <p>Our <strong>Teacher Applicational Platform (TAP)</strong> addresses inefficiencies in educator recruitment. Teachers create unified profiles while schools can filter and recruit with precision. Launching August 2025, TeacherSearch will:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Streamline job applications</li>
    <li>Support state schools facing shortages</li>
    <li>Create a centralised hiring ecosystem</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Designed with teachers in mind, this platform eliminates the need for repetitive, manual form-filling across different schools and institutions. Instead, educators can create a comprehensive, centralised profile detailing their qualifications, experience, and teaching preferences. Schools will then be able to search, filter, and connect directly with suitable candidates who have expressed interest in their vacancies. This approach not only saves time for teachers but also improves efficiency for school hiring processes — ultimately fostering better matches between schools and educators. The platform will be particularly beneficial for state schools facing staffing shortages, providing them with access to a broad and diverse pool of qualified candidates.
